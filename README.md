# twally
Rhymes with "tally." Display a tally of streaming tweets on an LED sign.

## Requirements
* Arduino Uno (probably works with some other boards)
* [Adafruit 16x32 RGB LED matrix](http://www.adafruit.com/product/420) (could be easily modified to work with their [32x32 RGB matrix](http://www.adafruit.com/products/607) or other signs)
* Ruby: twitter and rubyserial gems (twitter must be v5.14). I'm running ruby 2.2.
* Arduino C: Adafruit_GFX and RGBmatrixPanel libraries
